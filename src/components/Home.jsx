      <p>
        The Brihadeeswarar Temple, also known as the Big Temple, is one of the
        greatest glories of Indian architecture. It was built by Rajaraja
        Chola I in the 11th century. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and
        features a magnificent vimana (tower) that stands as a testament to the
        engineering and artistic skills of the Chola dynasty.
